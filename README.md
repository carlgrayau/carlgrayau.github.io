<p><h3>Short Answer Q&A - Include short answers to the following questions,</h3></p>
<p><b>Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)</b></p>
<p>The internet transitioned from a military defense network to a university network in the 1980â€™s. In 1989 Tim Berners-Less of the European Organization for Nuclear Research created the hypertext transfer protocol (http), a standardization that gave disparate computers the ability to access the same sites. He is credited as the father of the internet. In 1993 Mosaic was created by the NCSA, the first popular web browser.</p> 

<p>During 1997-2001 the first internet bubble grew and resulted in the dot-com crash of 2001.</p>

<p>From 2007 the mobile internet revolution took place with the mass adoption of smart phones that enabled internet browsing through mobiles rather than desktop computers. This also included the growth in wireless technology from 3d-4g and now the incoming 5g technologies to support mobile internet.</p>

<p><b>Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)</b></p>
<p>Domains are a realm of autonomy within the internet, they are formed within the Domain Name System, which is a registry of domains that represent Internet Protocol addresses.</p>
<p>A web server is hardware or software that can serve to the World Wide Web. This involves storing, processing and delivering web pages to clients using the HTTP. </p>
<p>Web browsers are software applications for accessing information on the World Wide Web (these include Chrome, Safari, Firefox etc.)</p>

<p><b>Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)</b></p>
<p>Wifi was introduced in 1998, with key researches from the Australian organization the CSIRO being credited with inventing Wi-Fi. </p>

<p>This has enabled consumers and businesses to operate on networks and the internet without the use of direct cable link, making the internet and connectivity far more seamless. </p>

<p>From internet cafes to flights, consumers are able to connect online from their computers enabling mobility and ease of use. </p>
